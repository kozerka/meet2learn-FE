## Technological Enhancements

### Backend-Driven Performance
- **Efficiency and Speed**: Key functionalities are implemented on the backend to enhance application performance.

### React Creatable Select
- **Dynamic Tagging**: Implemented React Creatable Select for dynamic tagging capabilities. This feature allows users, especially tutors, to add custom tags dynamically, enhancing the searchability and categorization of their profiles and posts.

### Form Handling with Formik and Yup
- **Streamlined Form Management**: Utilized Formik for efficient form handling, significantly simplifying the process of managing form state and submissions.
- **Validation**: Integrated Yup with Formik to provide a seamless and robust validation mechanism. This combination allows for the creation of distinct validation schemas, ensuring data integrity and user-friendly feedback on form inputs.

```javascript
 export const useLoginForm = (dispatch, navigate) => {
	return useFormik({
		initialValues: { email: '', password: '' },
		validationSchema: loginFormSchema,
		onSubmit: async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
			try {
				const actionResponse = await dispatch(loginUser(values));
				if (loginUser.fulfilled.match(actionResponse)) {
					dispatch(fetchUser());
					toast.success('Login successful!');
					navigate('/dashboard');
				} else {
					throw actionResponse;
				}
			} catch (error) {
				const errorMessage = error?.payload?.message || 'Error occurred during login';
				toast.error(errorMessage);
			} finally {
				setSubmitting(false);
			}
		},
	});
};
```

### Redux Toolkit with createAsyncThunk 
- **State Management**: Used Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, making the application's state predictable and easier to manage.
- **Asynchronous Actions**: Leveraged createAsyncThunk for handling asynchronous actions. This modern approach simplifies the handling of API calls and data fetching, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: The use of Redux Toolkit and createAsyncThunk not only improves application performance but also enhances the developer experience by reducing boilerplate code and providing powerful tools for debugging and state observation.


### Custom Hooks for Component Management
- **Custom Hooks**: In the case of large and complex components, implemented custom React hooks. This approach allows to encapsulate component logic and state management, making the components more organized and maintainable.
- **Logical Separation**: Moving the logic into separate custom hooks makes the codebase cleaner but also enhances readability and makes debugging easier.
- **Reusable Logic**: Custom hooks offer the advantage of reusability. The same logic can be employed across different components, reducing redundancy and keeping the code DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself).
```javascript
export const useTutorData = tutorId => {
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const { tutor, isLoading: isTutorLoading } = useSelector(state => state.tutors);
	const { reviews, isLoading: isReviewsLoading } = useSelector(state => state.reviews);
	const [editingReview, setEditingReview] = useState(null);

	useEffect(() => {
		if (tutorId) {
			dispatch(getTutorById(tutorId));
			dispatch(getTutorReviews(tutorId));
			dispatch(fetchUser());
		}
	}, [dispatch, tutorId]);

	const isLoading = isTutorLoading || isReviewsLoading;

	return { tutor, reviews, isLoading, editingReview, setEditingReview };
};
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To use this application locally, you need to download both this repository and the backend repository - > [go to BE repository](https://github.com/kozerka/meet2learn-BE). Follow the instructions in each repository for setup. The application has both 'develop' branches configured to use online, however, if you want to run the application with a local backend, you must follow the specific instructions provided in the documentation.

## üëâ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd [Repo-Name]
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   
The application will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Future Development Plans

The application is set for some exciting updates. Here's what's planned for the future:

- **Introduction of Admin Role**: The backend and routing have been designed to easily add an admin role. This role will bring new levels of management and oversight to the app.

- **Two-Step Verification for Tutor Accounts**: There are plans to add a two-step verification process for tutors. This will help in ensuring that the content they publish is secure and trustworthy.

- **Expanded Dashboard Notifications**: The dashboard will be upgraded to show more notifications. Users will be informed about new posts, comments, messages from tutors, and other important updates.

- **User Engagement Enhancements**: The app will include new features to make it more interactive and engaging. This might include elements like badges for achievements or personalized learning paths.

- **Mobile App Development**: Plans are in the works to develop a mobile version of the app, making it easy for users to access the platform from anywhere.

These updates are aimed at making the app more user-friendly, secure, and engaging. Keep an eye out for these exciting changes!
